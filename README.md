`funktx` is mainly two things.  
A library designed to enable functional programming in JavaScript.  
And optionally, some loose and not so loose ideas on coding.

Yes we think it's easier  
both short, and long term  
to code in a certain way,  
and so we try to make it as friction less as possible;  
but also not push it.

The mission is  
to make functional programming accessible to developers of all backgrounds,  
by  
providing an end to end solution,  
and a minimal, complete set of tools,  
that are easy to pick,  
and play well with other libraries and frameworks.

## Ideology

We believe that functional programming has more to offer.  
It isn't really that complicated,  
and shouldn't need a degree to try it.

The ecosystem is not making it that easy though.

We believe that functional programming should be accessible to everyone.  
So that one can get started,  
and get going fast.  
Alongside their team.

Our goal is to provide the team with the tools they need to start writing functional code today,  
regardless of their experience with FP  
or background.

So whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out with functional programming,  
we invite you to join us.
